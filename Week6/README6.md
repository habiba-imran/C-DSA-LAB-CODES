# 🚀 Linked List and Stack Operations in C++  

## 📌 Overview  

This C++ program demonstrates three exercises related to **Linked Lists** and **Stacks**:  

1️⃣ **Exercise 6.1**: Testing various linked list functions such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.  
2️⃣ **Exercise 6.2**: Reversing a string using a stack implemented with a linked list.  
3️⃣ **Exercise 6.3**: Performing operations on a linked list using user input.  

## 🛠️ Features  

✔️ Implements a **generic linked list** using templates.  
✔️ Uses a **stack-based approach** to reverse a string.  
✔️ Allows **user-defined input** for linked list operations.  

## 🔧 Prerequisites  

- 🖥️ C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)  
- 📚 Basic understanding of **Linked Lists** and **Stacks**  

## 📁 File Structure  

📂 `main.cpp` – Contains the main function to run the program.  
📂 `LinkedList.h` – Implements the generic linked list.  
📂 `LinkedStr.h` – Implements additional linked list operations.  

## ▶️ Compilation and Execution  

1️⃣ Compile the program using a C++ compiler:  
   ```sh
   g++ main.cpp -o linkedlist
