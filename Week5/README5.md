# 🚀 Priority Queue Implementation (PQueue)  

This repository contains an implementation of a **Priority Queue (PQueue)** using an array of queues, where each queue represents a priority level. The task elements are inserted into the priority queue based on their priority, and tasks are removed in order of priority (highest first). This implementation uses a **`Queue` class** and a **`PQueue` class**.  

## 📌 Overview  

A **priority queue** is a data structure that allows elements to be stored and removed based on their priority, rather than the order in which they were added. Tasks with a higher priority are removed before those with the lower priority.  

🔹 **`Queue<T>`** handles the queue functionality for each priority level.  
🔹 **`PQueue<T>`** manages multiple `Queue` objects, each corresponding to a priority level.  

### ⭐ Key Features:  
✅ Supports **N priority levels**.  
✅ **FIFO** (First-In-First-Out) order is maintained for tasks within each priority level.  
✅ **Insert** and **Remove** operations handle tasks based on priority.  

## 🏗️ Classes  

### 📌 `Queue<T>`  
A template class representing a simple queue that supports the following operations:  
🟢 `insert(T item)`: Adds an item to the queue.  
🔴 `remove(T& item)`: Removes and retrieves the front item from the queue.  
📏 `isFull()`: Checks if the queue is full.  
📭 `isEmpty()`: Checks if the queue is empty.  

### 📌 `PQueue<T>`  
A template class representing the priority queue that handles multiple queues for different priority levels. It supports the following operations:  
🟢 `insert(T item, int p)`: Inserts an item into the queue corresponding to its priority level.  
🔴 `remove(T& item)`: Removes and retrieves the highest-priority item from the queue.  
📏 `isFull()`: Checks if all priority levels are full.  
📭 `isEmpty()`: Checks if all priority levels are empty.  

## 🔧 How to Use  

1️⃣ **Include the header files:**  

   The header files `Queue.h` and `PQueue.h` are required to use the classes.  

2️⃣ **Create an instance of `PQueue`:**  
   Initialize a `PQueue` object with the number of priority levels you want. The number of priority levels defines the range of valid priority values.  

   Example:  
   ```cpp
   int N = 5;  // Number of priority levels (from 0 to N-1)
   PQueue<string> pq(N);
